# grabinput
Unixy lib for reading from a file or from stdin

> Note: This library provides no real safety features. If you don't want simple, no-hassle input, don't use it. This is intended to blow up in your face if anything goes wrong. That's a feature, not a bug. Seriously, it doesn't even lock standard input before reading it. Ok? Ok. Just wanted to be sure we were clear on that. :)
